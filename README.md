# Memory Matcher

A retro grid-based game in JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Memory Game is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turning over 2 cards at a time.  As the timer counts down, get as many pairs as you can before the timer runs out.

### Technologies Used

JavaScript, CSS and HTML

### Game Pictures


### Next Steps

I would like to add a start screen before starting the game.  Create a fix for the double clicking in the game. Stop timer when you win the game
